## Snake Game in Java

### Overview

This project is a classic Snake game implemented in Java. It serves as a fun and educational project to brush up on Java skills and demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts. The game involves navigating a snake to eat food and grow in size while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

### Features

- **Simple Controls:** Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of your score based on the number of food items eaten.
- **Game Over Detection:** The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- **Responsive Gameplay:** Smooth and responsive controls for an enjoyable gaming experience.
- **Customizable Settings:** Adjust game speed and other settings to suit your preference.

### Technologies Used

- **Java:** The core programming language used for developing the game.
- **Swing:** For creating the graphical user interface (GUI) and rendering the game.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Demonstrates the use of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-java.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash

    javac src/*.java
    ```
4. Run the game:
    ```bash
    java -cp src SnakeGame
    ```

### Usage
